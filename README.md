# MultiResistance-Antibiotics-Susceptibility
This project explores multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns among bacteria isolated from patient samples. The analysis focuses on identifying resistance rates to different antibiotics and understanding how factors such as diabetes status, hypertension, gender, infection frequency, and previous hospital visits influence antibiotic effectiveness.
