# MultiResistance-Antibiotics-Susceptibility
This project explores multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns among bacteria isolated from patient samples. The analysis focuses on identifying resistance rates to different antibiotics and understanding how factors such as diabetes status, hypertension, gender, infection frequency, and previous hospital visits influence antibiotic effectiveness.


## Tools
Power BI | Power Query | Excel (CSV Dataset)

## Dataset Source 
WebsiteKaggle – Multi-Resistance Antibiotic Susceptibility[]


## Process & Tools:
Using Power Query, the dataset was cleaned and transformed to prepare for analysis. Microsoft Power BI was then used to build interactive dashboards that visualize resistance levels, antibiotic susceptibility, and the impact of patient-related factors. These visual insights help reveal emerging resistance trends and correlations between health conditions and bacterial responseer BI



## Outcome
The project provides data-driven insights to support healthcare professionals in monitoring resistance patterns, identifying high-risk bacteria, and improving antibiotic stewardship strategies. The dashboard helps drive evidence-based decisions for infection control and treatment planning.

### Overview
Of the 7784 samples tested, 32.4% of the samples were resistant to antibiotics. In 2021, the resistant rate was the highest, while 2025 has recorded the lowest resistant rate. This could be due to  increase in awareness of antibiotics resistance  in the community.

### Bacteria
_Eucherichia coli_ had the highest test samples and resistance rate among the strains of bacteria tested. The test was free of bias because, the number of sample did ot influence resistance rate. For instance, _Enterobacter spp_ with the second highest test samples was not the next in resistant rate.

### Antibiotics
Amoxicillin and the ampicillin/cloxacillin combination were the antibiotics that most bacterias were resistant to.

### Patient demography
Hypertensive and diabetes status did not have significant effect on resistant rate. Only gender had a significant effect on resistant rate. Male were more resistant to antibiotics than female.
